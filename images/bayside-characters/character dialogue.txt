Hi I'm Todd, I've never done one of these before, but I'm a taurus, I got tickets to my new favorite band LungButter, they're kind of a post-grunge metal-punk with screamo influence and a dj. It's cool if you haven't heard of them, they're pretty underground, I wrote a zine about them last year and the saxaphonist mentioned it on stage, and ... yeah did I say I'm a taurus?

Claurnessa - so Veruca and Quartnee were both at Mardels picking up their new bible covers and when they came out they totally saw chette macgruber in his dumb little skater pads fall on his face into the parking lot! Oh that reminds me in miss millers class I heard rainbow dauche humming a little song and I was like "oh I know that song from somewhere" so I leaned in to ask her about it and I saw she was drawing her little friend morgan and that's when I realized the song was "a little more time on you" by nsync and when she saw I was looking at her and could see what she was drawing her FACE! <breaks into laughter> anyway what did you want? Oh I'm claurnessa.

Jenny - Quartanee said what? Well did you know she doesn't even have horses? She has cows. Horses are better than cows in almost every way, let me list them: you can ride them. They aren't economically exploitable. They're independant and their free spirit inspires me daily. They're magestic, and COWS ARE NOT MAGESTIC QUARTANEE JONES.

Rainbow - Oh sorry I'm just waiting for my gir - my friend morgan to get out of the bathroom. I'm Rainbow! My parents were kinda hippies, but I think the name suits me! Want a sticker? its by my favorite designer, lisa frank!

Helo I am Zaqque, I am an exchange student here at bayside high, there are many exchange students but I am the only one from french quebec, which is in canada in case you did no know. I am frequently teased and bullied for my accent and for my parents religion, even though I conistently tell everyone I am more of a Hegelian skeptic and Sartresque Existentialist than a catholic. Stupide.
